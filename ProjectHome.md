# Welcome to the Storm Lottery Project #

First source will be uploaded shortly as I am still working on it. :P

## History ##
This project came about as for a personal need for lottery software. I have chosen to make this open source as my limited knowledge in PHP MySQL will make this a slow go for just me.

## Goals ##
#1 Easy to use interface for setting up Private & Public Lotteries. <br>
#2 Provide a solution to display current and previous Lotteries <br>

As this project grows this website will reflect any changes I have made.
